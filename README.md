# Putty-settings
**Putty_Dark_Pastel_color_scheme.reg** file applies Dark Pastel color scheme to your Putty default profile.

**show_color_scheme.sh** file displays Dark Pastel color scheme with RGB values, if your terminal supports RGB settings. For instance, Putty does not support it. I managed to make it work in Ubuntu terminal in Windows.


This is the desired output:
